# Note on cell type annotations

These cell labels are generated based on a combination of assignments from CellTypist (https://www.celltypist.org) and unsupervised clustering, manually combined and verified based on expression of known marker genes. 
They have not been FACS sorted or labeled via cell surface markers, and we were unable to determine a cell type for some cells (labeled as Unknown1 and Unknown2.)
As such, these labels should not be treated as definitive or as a gold standard.
If your use case for this data requires greater precision, we recommend you manually inspect them based on marker gene expression and alter cell types as needed. CellTypist runs quickly and is a great first step to start from scratch.
